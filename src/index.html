10 PRINT THEREMIN
A 219bytes demo by @p01 first presented at Web Rebels 2016 

This comment and anything after it can be removed without altering this demo.

This demonstration recreates two things in the fewest bytes possible:

1. The famous labyrinth from the C64 Basic program "10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10" which serves as a lens to explore creative coding and programing in society in the book of the same name. ( http://10print.org )

2. A theremin instrument ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin ) using the Web Audio API and the mouse coordinates to map the distance of the hands to the antenas.

Hope you appreciate this,
